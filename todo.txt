Make ChartDatum publishable: viewmodel tests first. Add it to the DiaryViewModelInterface. Migrate and delete the non-published property. Add a snapshot test to show data changing.
Have chart visibility react to changes in chart data.
Rename score in entry view model to indicate that it's a string representation.
